Description: Facilitate retrieval, transformation and analysis of the data
    from the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) database. It allows both
    public and private user data to be easily downloaded easily into the R
    environment using a variety of inputs such as: processids, sampleids,
    taxonomy, geography etc. The package provides data transformation
    functions to convert data into formats compatible with other
    R-packages and third party tools, as well as analysis functions for
    biodiversity, clustering and mapping.
