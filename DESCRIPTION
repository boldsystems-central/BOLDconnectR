    from the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) database <http:https://boldsystems.org/>. 
    This package allows both public and private user data to be easily downloaded easily into the R
    environment using a variety of inputs such as: processids, sampleids, 
    taxonomy, geography etc. It provides the functionality to convert data 
    into formats compatible with other R-packages and third-party tools, 
    as well as analysis functions for biodiversity, clustering and mapping.
